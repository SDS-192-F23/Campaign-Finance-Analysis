```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(fec20)
```

```{r helper-chunk}
# Look at help file
?contributions

# Note that the contributions data frame only contains the first 1000 rows:
contributions

# Download full contributions data from web and overwrite contributions using:
# read_all_*() function.
# You will need to install the usethis package for this line of code to work
contributions <- read_all_contributions()

# Now contributions has full 887,823 rows
contributions
```

```{r analysis-1}
condensed_contributions<-contributions|>
  select(transaction_tp, entity_tp, name, transaction_amt,cand_id)|>
  filter(transaction_amt >= 10000)

















```

```{r analysis-2}
# Ellie's Work------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
```

```{r}
#checking if there are any IND values in our dataset 
contributions_condensed_ind <- condensed_contributions |>
  filter(entity_tp %in% c("IND")) 
glimpse(contributions_condensed_ind)

```

Question of interest: 
What are the economic demographics of individuals who donate to campaigns? Does one party receive more contributions from individuals greater than $10,000 than another? Does one party receive more contributions from individuals less than $1000 than another?
