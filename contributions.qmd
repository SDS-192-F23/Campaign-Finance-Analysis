I think we did a pretty good job at splitting up the work in this project. We did exploratory data analysis together and collaborated on coming up with a question to focus on. Then we each took a separate angle related to our question and did independent data wrangling in order to create data visualizations that answered our questions. Kat did a good job of joining and recoding the data frames to make it easier to work with. Ellie focused on individuals donating to committees and successfully removed instances of double commas. Both Ellie and Kat worked well over Git, committing without any problem, reviewing each others' commits, and assigning issues. Ellie wrote the introduction to the blog post, half of the second paragraph, and the ethical concern.
